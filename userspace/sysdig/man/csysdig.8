.SS NAME
.PP
csysdig \- the ncurses user interface for sysdig
.SS SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]csysdig\f[] [\f[I]option\f[]]...
[\f[I]filter\f[]]
.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
csysdig exports sysdig\[aq]s functionality through an intuitive and
powerful ncurses\-based user interface.
.PP
csysdig has been designed to mimic tools like \f[B]top\f[] and
\f[B]htop\f[], but it offers richer functionality, including:
.IP \[bu] 2
Support for both live analysis and sysdig trace files.
Trace files can come from the same machine or from another machine.
.IP \[bu] 2
Visibility into a broad range of metrics, including CPU, memory, disk
I/O, network I/O.
.IP \[bu] 2
Ability to observe input/output activity for processes, files, network
connections and more.
.IP \[bu] 2
Ability to drill down into processes, files, network connections and
more to further explore their behavior.
.IP \[bu] 2
Full customization support.
.IP \[bu] 2
Support for sysdig\[aq]s filtering language.
.IP \[bu] 2
Container support by design.
.PP
csysdig works on any terminal, and has support for colors and mouse
input.
.PP
\f[B]Views\f[]
.PP
csysdig is based on the concept of \[aq]views\[aq], little Lua scripts
that determine how metrics are collected, processed and represented on
screen.
Including a new visualization to csysdig doesn\[aq]t require to update
the program, and is simply a matter of adding a new view.
Views rely on the sysdig processing engine, and this means that they can
include any sysdig filter field.
Views are located in the sysdig chisel directory path, usually
\f[I]/usr/share/sysdig/chisels\f[] and \f[I]~/.chisels\f[].
.SS BASIC USAGE
.PP
Here are some basic tips to get you started with sysdig:
.IP "1." 3
If you run csysdig without arguments, it will display live system data,
updating every 2 seconds.
To analyze a trace file, use the \-r command line flag.
.IP "2." 3
You can switch to a different view by using the \f[I]F2\f[] key.
.IP "3." 3
You can drill down into a selection by clicking \f[I]enter\f[].
You can navigate back by typing \f[I]backspace\f[].
.IP "4." 3
You can observe input/output for the currently selected entity by typing
\f[I]F5\f[]
.IP "5." 3
You can see sysdig events for the currently selected entity by typing
\f[I]F6\f[]
.SS DRILLING DOWN
.PP
You drill down by selecting an element in a view and then clicking
\f[I]enter\f[].
Once inside a selection, you can switch to a different view, and the new
view will be applied in the context of the selection.
For example, if you drill down into a process called foo and then switch
to the \f[I]Connections\f[] view, the output will include only the
connections made or received by \f[I]foo\f[].
.PP
To drill down multiple times, keep clicking \f[I]enter\f[].
For example, you can click on a container in the \f[I]Containers\f[]
view to get the processes running inside it, and then click on one of
the processes to see its threads.
.SS ACTIONS AND HOTKEYS
.PP
Each view has a list of command lines that can be executed in the
context of the current selection by pressing \[aq]hotkeys\[aq].
For example, pressing \[aq]k\[aq] in the Processes view kills the
selected process, pressing \[aq]b\[aq] in the Containers view opens a
bash shell in the selected container.
.PP
Each view supports different actions.
You can see which actions a view supports by pressing F8.
You can customize the view\[aq]s actions by editing the view\[aq]s Lua
file.
.SS CONTAINERS SUPPORT
.PP
Starting csysdig with the \-pc command line switch will cause many of
the views to include additional container information.
For example, the \f[I]Processes\f[] will include a column showing the
container the process belongs to.
Similarly, the \f[I]Connections\f[] view will show which container each
connection belongs to.

.IP \[bu] 2

.IP \[bu] 2
Double clicking on row entries performs a drill down.

Clicking on the filter string at the top of the screen (the text after
\[aq]Filter:\[aq]) lets you change the sysdig filter and customize the
view content.
.IP \[bu] 2
You can use the mouse on the entries in the menu at the bottom of the
screen to perform their respective actions.
.SS COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
.PP
\f[B]\-d\f[] \f[I]period\f[], \f[B]\-\-delay\f[]=\f[I]period\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Set the delay between updates, in milliseconds (by default = 2000).
This works similarly to the \-d option in top.
.PP
\f[B]\-E\f[], \f[B]\-\-exclude\-users\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Don\[aq]t create the user/group tables by querying the OS when sysdig
starts.
This also means that no user or group info will be written to the
tracefile by the \-w flag.
The user/group tables are necessary to use filter fields like user.name
or group.name.
However, creating them can increase sysdig\[aq]s startup time.
.PP
\f[B]\-\-force\-term\-compat\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Try to configure simple terminal settings (xterm\-1002) that work better
with terminals like putty.
Try to use this flag if you experience terminal issues like the mouse
not working.

.PD
Enable Kubernetes support by connecting to the API server specified as
argument.
E.g.
"<http://admin:password@127.0.0.1:8080>".
The API server can also be specified via the environment variable
SYSDIG_K8S_API.
.PP
\f[B]\-K\f[] \f[I]btfile | certfile:keyfile[#password][:cacertfile]\f[],
\f[B]\-\-k8s\-api\-cert=\f[]\f[I]btfile |

.PD 0
.P
.PD
Use the provided files names to authenticate user and (optionally)
verify the K8S API server identity.
Each entry must specify full (absolute, or relative to the current
directory) path to the respective file.
Private key password is optional (needed only if key is password
protected).
CA certificate is optional.
For all files, only PEM file format is supported.
Specifying CA certificate only is obsoleted \- when single entry is
provided for this option, it will be interpreted as the name of a file
containing bearer token.
Note that the format of this command\-line option prohibits use of files
whose names contain \[aq]:\[aq] or \[aq]#\[aq] characters in the file
name.
Option can also be provided via the environment variable
SYSDIG_K8S_API_CERT.
.PP

.PP
\f[B]\-m\f[] \f[I]url[,marathon\-url]\f[],
\f[B]\-\-mesos\-api=\f[]\f[I]url[,marathon\-url]\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Enable Mesos support by connecting to the API server specified as
argument (e.g.
<http://admin:password@127.0.0.1:5050>).
Mesos url is required.
Marathon url is optional, defaulting to auto\-follow \- if Marathon API
server is not provided, csysdig will attempt to retrieve (and
subsequently follow, if it migrates) the location of Marathon API server
from the Mesos master.
Note that, with auto\-follow, csysdig will likely receive a cluster
internal IP address for Marathon API server, so running csysdig with
Marathon auto\-follow from a node that is not part of Mesos cluster may
not work.
Additionally, running csysdig with Mesos support on a node that has no
containers managed by Mesos is of limited use because, although cluster
metadata will be collected, there will be no Mesos/Marathon filtering
capability.
The API servers can also be specified via the environment variable
SYSDIG_MESOS_API.

Capture the first \f[I]len\f[] bytes of each I/O buffer.
By default, the first 80 bytes are captured.
Use this option with caution, it can generate huge trace files.
.PP
\f[B]\-T\f[], \f[B]\-\-force\-tracers\-capture\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Tell the driver to make sure full buffers are captured from /dev/null,
to make sure that tracers are completely captured.
Note that sysdig will enable extended /dev/null capture by itself after
detecting that tracers are written there, but that could result in the
truncation of some tracers at the beginning of the capture.
This option allows preventing that.
.PP
\f[B]\-v\f[] \f[I]view_id\f[], \f[B]\-\-views\f[]=\f[I]view_id\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD

View IDs can be found in the view documentation pages in csysdig.
Combine this option with a command line filter for complete output
customization.
.PP
\f[B]\-\-version\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Print version number.
.SS FILTERING
.PP
Similarly to what you do with sysdig, you can specify a filter on the
command line to restrict the events that csysdig processes.
To modify the filter while the program is running, or to add a filter at
runtime, click on the filter text in the UI with the mouse.
.SS CUSTOMIZING CSYSDIG
.PP
csysdig is completely customizable.
This means that you can modify any of the csysdig views, and even create
your own views.
Like sysdig chisels, csysdig views are Lua scripts.
Full information can be found at the following github wiki page:
