/**
 * Base class for classes that need to collect values asynchronously from some
 * value source.  Subclasses will override the the run_impl() method and
 * implement the concrete value lookup behavior.  In that method, subclasses
 * will use use dequeue_next_key() method to get the key that it will use to
 * collect the value(s), collect the appropriate value(s), and call the
 * store_value() method to save the value.  The run_impl() method should
 * continue to dequeue and process values while the dequeue_next_key() method
 * returns true.
 *
 * The constructor for this class accepts a maximum wait time; this specifies
 * how long client code is willing to wait for a synchronous response (i.e.,
 * how long the lookup() method will block waiting for the requested value).
 * If the async_key_value_source is able to collect the requested value
 * within that time period, then the lookup() method will return them.
 *
 * If the lookup() method is unable to collect the requested value within
 * the requested time period, then one of two things will happen.
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>If the client supplied a callback handler in the call to lookup(), then
 *     that callback handler will be invoked by the async_key_value_source once
 *     the value has been collected.  Note that the callback handler will be
 *     invoked in the context of the asynchronous thread associated with the
 *     async_key_value_source.</li>
 * <li>If the client did not supply a handler, then the value will be stored,
 *     and the next call to the lookup() method with the same key will return
 *     the previously collected value.  If lookup() is not called with the
 *     specified ttl time, then this component will prune the stored value.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * @tparam key_type   The type of the keys for which concrete subclasses will
 *                    query.  This type must have a valid operator==().
 * @tparam value_type The type of value that concrete subclasses will
 *                    receive from a query.  This type must have a valid
 *                    operator=().
