[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/draios/sysdig.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/draios/sysdig)

Welcome to **sysdig** - an open source system-level exploration and troubleshooting tool. 

Where to start?
---
If this is your first time hearing about sysdig, we recommend you [start with the website] (http://www.sysdig.org).  
  
What does sysdig do and why should I use it?
---
Sysdig captures system calls and other system level events using a linux kernel facility called tracepoints, providing a rich set of real-time, system-level information.

Sysdig "packetizes" this information, so that you can do things like save it into trace files and easily filter it, a bit like you would do with tcpdump. This makes it very flexible to explore what processes are doing.

Sysdig is also packed with a set of scripts called Chisels that make it easier to extract useful information and do troubleshooting.

Sysdig is designed from the ground up for minimal overhead and is production ready.
